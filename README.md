This is project for C# classes on physics faculty in WUT, Poland.
This is "zero plyer game" inspired by Particle Life on Google Play Store:

The main idea of the program is to simulate different particles interacting with each other but we neglect 3rd rule od dynamics, i.e. the forces affecting two particles are not symetrical.
This can lead to interesting behaviors.

In my program I use icons dowlnoaded from the Flaticon:
https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/add   - add icon created by Pixel perfect,
https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/minus - minus icon created by Pixel perfect,
https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/grab   - grab icon created by Kiranshastry.
https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/trash - trash icon created by Freepik
